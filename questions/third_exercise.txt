   Assignment:
   (1) Suppose the coming sequence into a stack is: 1，2，3，4. Write a function to print all the possibilities of output sequence.
   (2) Input a positive integer n(n>=3)，write a function to print all the possibilities of combination of 1,1,2,2,3,3,......,n,n( 2n numbers altogether) that satisfies：
    there is 1 integer between two “1”s
    there are 2 integers between two “2”s
    there are 3 integers between two “3”s
    ......
    there are n integers between two “n”s
    for example of 3，the two possible sequence are:231213 or 312132.
    Pay attention, there may be 0 or many possible sequences, print them all。
