   Write a program that produces the result of multiplication of two polynomials, based on the source code for addtition.
   The function main() should be like this:
int main()
{
   Polynomial ah,bh,ch;
   ah.inputPoly();      //input polynomial a
   ah.outputPoly();
   bh.inputPoly();      //input polynomial b
   bh.outputPoly();
   ch = ah*bh;
   ch.outputPoly();    //output the result
   return 0;
}
Pay attention to the following demands:

   (1)Both sequential storage and linked storage approach can be adopted.
   (2)Minus exponent is allowed.
   (3)The result must be stored in a newly-created polynomial, keeping ah and bh unchanged.
